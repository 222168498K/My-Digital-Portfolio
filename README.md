>
>### REFELCTION
>**Situation:**  
>In the business communication module, we studied the role played by written correspondence in creating professional impressions. We were taught how to write business email, write formally and be confident, but to be respectful and clear.
>
>**Task:**  
>I was assigned a task to compose a formal e-mail to a company that would provide some information concerning a possible internship placement. The idea was to show the level of professionalism and clarity in expressing interest in taking industry experience.
>
>**Action:**  
>I have looked into ICT companies that are pertinent to my field and have found out the relevant contact persons. I started every e-mail with a clear heading and a polite greeting as well as a brief self-introduction. I quickly presented my professional and educational competencies, and then indicated the reason of my contact. I was very formal, never used long sentences and had to proofread my emails before sending it. I had also included my CV and contacts in a clean and professional manner.
>
>**Result:**  
>Some of the companies have reacted favorably and this was due to my professionalism and interest. The exercise reinforced my belief in professional communication, and I learned that it is important to use the tone, structure, and pay attention to details. I understood that proper and polite conversation is an indicator of ability to work and may bring openings to opportunities.

>### REFELCTION
>**Situation:**  
>The interview skills module was on the preparation of behavioral and technical interviews. We were talking about the necessity of being a confident person who is able to give organized responses supported by personal experiences.
>
>**Task:**  
>I was asked to prepare the structured answers to the behavioral interview questions like: â€œWrite about a situation that you cooperated well in a team, and you should tell me about a situation when you have faced a challenge and what you have done about it.
>
>**Action:**  
>I went through my academic projects and training activities in order to prepare to present some situations in which I demonstrated initiative, teamwork and problem-solving. I used the STAR approach in structuring every response, and I defined each response with a clear situation, task, action and result. I realized the answers aloud before the mirror and recorded myself to improve my tone and timbering. I also studied about the etiquette of the interview like posture, listening, non-verbal communication and active listening. This assisted me to develop self-understanding and calm down.
>
>**Result:**  
>My answers were more assertive, precise, and to the point. I also got to know how to connect my background to skills that employers seek and understood that to prepare an interview I have to reflect on myself and practice. I am now more confident in facing real interviews with a high level of professionalism.

>The mock interview was meant to simulate a real interview setup whereby the students would have a chance to use what they have learned in training. It challenged my verbal communication, self-presentation and capacity to remain calm in situations of pressure.

I ended up by posing dreadful questions regarding the organization, with curiosity and interest.
>

>
>### REFLECTIONS
>**Situation:**  
>During the professional networking module, we were taught that career development requires effective networking. The facilitator had clarified that in order to create connections, one has to be authentic, communicate effectively, and be consistent.
>
>**Task:**  
>I was supposed to find ICT professionals or companies and start playing the communicating game to ask about the opportunities to have an internship or to receive guidance on entering the field. The objective was to initiate the building of professional relationship outside of classroom set-up.
>
>**Action:**  
>I also did a search in LinkedIn and websites of companies and individuals that were appropriate. I wrote friendly and personalized emails, which touched on my backgrounds, what I am studying and the reason I was approaching. I made sure that my tone was polite and my LinkedIn profile was not incomplete and did not go against the information that I posted. I made proper follow up on my messages by appreciating the respondents who were responding to me. I also added some professionals on LinkedIn so that we could keep in touch.
>
>**Result:**  
>I got positive feedbacks and real world information regarding the ICT job market. The positive engagement further inspired me to proceed with networking even in the situations when there were not any internship opportunities. I got to know that professional networking is a long term process of establishing visibility and mutual trust. This experience assisted me to be more assured in addressing professionals and being proactive regarding career development.

>
>### REFLECTIONS
>**Situation:**  
> The module on workplace etiquette also discussed the value of professionalism and emotional intelligence in order to ensure a favorable workplace environment. We analysed real life situations where bad etiquette may face conflict or lack of understanding.
>
>**Task:**  
>In one of our online training sessions some of the participants kept having their microphones unmuted or would talk over others making the discussion flow hard to follow and the facilitator to control the session. 
>
>**Action:**  
>I was invited to assist in organizing the second virtual meeting and urging people to practice good online-etiquette in order to make the session more productive. Prior to the start of the meeting, I reminded participants of the importance of muting microphones not speaking, using the feature of raising hands, and having cameras on where possible to ensure engagement. These behaviors were also modeled by me, and I came in early, greeted other people professionally, and made sure that my background and attire was polite. In case of interruptions, I dealt with them in a polite way and reinforced the norms of meetings in a constructive and calm way.
>
>**Result:**  
>The meeting was much better structured, as there were better attendance and minimal interruptions. The facilitator, as well as my peers, liked the flow of communication that was more smooth. I also got to know that etiquette in the workplace is not just a matter concerning the individual behavior but also the ability to influence others positively. I showed respect, structure and composure by acting to facilitate a more professional and collaborative virtual environment.
